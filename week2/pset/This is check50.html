cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith,
 his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, 
slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not

nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. 
When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football 
were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left
